# InformationSystemAnalysisAndDesign
The Project is applying a few classification algorithms on a random dataset and
seeking the performance of the model that I have built. So, I have used 5
classification algorithms for my dataset. The algorithms are:- Logistic Regression,
SVM, Decision Tree, Confusion Matrix, and Random Forest. My goal was to find the
accuracy for the expected and predicted value of the data set and then cross-validation to choose the best test data which will give the best result.
